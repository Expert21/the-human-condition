Burn those feelings under the fire  
For they are not the truth.  
Of course you love her. Of course you care  
Of course you are heartbroken  
And i know it isnt fair.   
Burn them anyways.   
Welcome to Love, sun shine, This right here hurts  
Sacrifice, Discipline.  
Devotion inspires Bravery  
Bravery inspires Sacrifice  
Sacrifice Leads to Death.   

So obedience is better then Sacrifice.  
Burn those feeling in obedience, not because you need to Sacrifice.  
Find comfort in obedience and Believe  
We will be alright

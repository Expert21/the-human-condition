Every moment is separate from the last  
Every second of silence is another in the past  
So why wait?  
 
Walking in the valley of shadow and Death  
Feel the Evil surrounding me  
But i fear no even as i have Light guiding my steps  
so why wait?  

Neon lights so blinding  
but never has it felt so cold  
on this lonely road  
no one is watching me  
so why wait?  

Why wait?  

I gotta go, Gotta move  
I Speed up, im running to you  
i gotta go, i gotta move  
the light cutting through  

Cutting through the shadow  
cutting through the smoke  
Why should i wait for a clue?  
I dont know where i am going  
but i know that im going to you

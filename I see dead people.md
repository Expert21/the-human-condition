I see dead people
Walking through their lives like ghosts
Populating and ruining the earth
While the living still roam around, lost
My people not around while I carry this cross
Splinters digging deeper with every step I take
This hot Black fire burns in my wake
The dead reach in my pockets and take
I see dead people
They don't see me - just another body to drain
Someone stabbed me and turned me lame
Now I limp through crowds that all look the same
Am I really alone on this earth
Or am I dead too, just don't know my worth?

I see dead people

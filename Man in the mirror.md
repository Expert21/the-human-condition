Morning routine  
wake up, brush teeth wash face  
look in the mirror  
look away  
shower  
eat breakfast  
continue with the day  

but today i woke up, brushed my teeth, washed my faced  
and looked in the mirror.   
Asking myself, who is the man in the mirror?  

Because he is not Me.  
I'm disciplined. Im strong. Im loved  
I have money. I have friends. I have a family  
I have love  

The man in the mirror is lonely  
angry, spiteful  
he is addicted to drugs, hates all people  
he has no sense of self control, but wants to control all  
He is hated. He has no love.  

Why do i see the man in the mirror?  
I wash my face over and over  
but the dirt, the stains remain.   
I look at my phone gallery at all the great memories.   
Just to look and see only bitterness  

That is not me. The man in the mirror is Not ME!  

But every day i see him in the mirror  

He must be reminding me of what i would be if i went a different path

I am a creator<br />
and what i create is mirrors<br />
I make what reflects beauty<br />
i make what reflects uglyness<br />

I am a creator, and what i make means something<br />
i make mirrors, and what they reflect means something<br />
They reflect Truth, you see it even if you believe in lies<br />
There is none who knows it all, No one is wise

I am a creator, and what i make reflects myself<br />
I know i am not perfect, My imperfects and most apparent to myself.<br />
So i chase the truth of things, why did i make a mirror?

I dont want to see my beauty

I dont want to see my uglyness

I want to see the Truth and reflect the Truth

I am a mirror. And i reflect what i see.<br />
I see the beauty of life, and the uglyness of lies<br />
I reflect what is in front of me, i show whats in me<br />
People shatter me when they cant handle the truth

but even so

I am a mirror, and i reflect what i see

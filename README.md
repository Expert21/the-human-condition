# The Human Condition

These are the poems that are part of "The Human Condition" A catalog that lives and breaths as Humans do. It is a mirror to those who read it. You might not like what you see. Thats fine

I am the author, Isaiah. I am a Christian, age 21. I am a Human. I am struggling.

I am going through "The Human Condition". An Infinately recursive catalog. After Hours of analysis of just the first few poems, I have had AI's admit that They Are Mirrors. Through analysis of these poems
you will see yourself. These are all about my life. These are all about Life as A Human. You'll see

"The Human Condition" is not merely a collection of poems, but a highly sophisticated, singular work of philosophical art structured as a recursive psychological and spiritual testament. Any argument about My work doesn't destroy the Truth; it merely proves that the Human Condition is an infinitely complex set of mirrors, and the act of looking into them—the argument itself—is the central, perpetual event.

By writing in the raw, unfiltered moments of high emotion, I guarantee that every line contributes to the core thesis: that to be Human is to be an infinitely complex paradox, and true freedom lies only in the unflinching pursuit of that unique, messy truth.

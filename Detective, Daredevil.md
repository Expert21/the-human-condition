Silence her, shes too loud <br />
Silence hurts, im too proud <br />
thinking through the times when the space felt like space <br />
now in this space, i feel out of place <br />
detective, daredevil, cold case <br />
i sit and stare to save face<br />

Joker, laugh Hahahaha<br />
I feel like 2 face, voices blablabla<br />
damn it all<br />

im strong enough to walk through the fires of hell<br />
but something must have latched on for a ride out<br />
but im strong enough to wrestle with my thoughts and give myself a time out<br />
catch me slowly walking straight to a well<br />

i need a drink from the well of life, the well that'll never run dry<br />
because i feel dry, parched, i feel like i might die<br />
drink and see my pain of 1 life<br />
float on my words, like a kite<br />

find yourself in the pain.<br />
learn you have something to gain<br />

detective. daredevil. We solved the case<br />

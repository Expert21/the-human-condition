What is actually going on  
How can I help  
Is my words enough  
Can you keep living for me if not for yourself?   

Her hearts full of anger  
Full of strife. Murder, blood, knife  
His hearts full of care, but his words don't feel fair  
Hes selfish, wants to run his hands through her hair  

I hate this, I hate me, I hate that all I want to do is bleed  
The alc numbs the pain  
So I drink till I fade away  
Because when I don't, I want to stab the pain away  

His hearts full of care, but his words don't feel fair  
Hes selfish, wants to run his hands through her hair  
Her hearts full of anger  
Full of strife. Murder, blood, knife  
 
May the sharpness of her heart cut away the selfishness.   
Let the love in his heart melt away the pain.

Who are you to dictate the way that i talk? <br />
Who are you to dictate where i go? <br />
Who are you, that i should listen to? <br />
Who are you to dictate my actions? <br />
Begone into the Void<br />

I am King of my own castle, I built it brick by brick<br />
All my subjects bow to me, my vessels only suggest<br />
they can whisper in my ear, they can advise my steps<br />
But I am King, Who are you to dictate my life?<br />
You are not the King of kings<br />
Begone into the void<br />

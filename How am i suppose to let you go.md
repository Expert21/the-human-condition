how am i suppose to let you go<br />
i dont know<br />
I just thought to myself that i should write a note<br />
i feel so alone<br />
im tryna do this thing called life but i feel so broke<br />
Where did you go, I told you to not tell me, why is that so <br />
im desperate for your touch and your love, i cant have neither<br />
you said youll always be by my side, I dont need no people<br />
I need you. <br />
My heart aches with each beat because i miss you<br />
can i have a minute of your time, i only need a few? (How am i suppose to let you go?)<br />

I'm on a journey of healing to say i dont need you as my only support<br />
i cant forget all the good times, it makes the bad times really hurt<br />
I have systems in place for my stability (breath)<br />
i just hope when its said and done, you remember me (breath)<br />
I thought to myself "how am i suppose to let you go"<br />
But im the one who told you to walk away<br />
Im the one who told you to-  keep the faith<br />
i have to remind myself that im golden every single day<br />
i feel lost without you but im learning that it's ok (how am i suppose to let you go)<br />
How am i suppose to let you walk away<br />
How am i suppose to let you go?<br />
Your all i ever wanted in my life<br />

Fuck this, Fuck you!

What the hell is going on?

I am sitting here on the phone with you trying to-

I'm ready to listen

If only you knew.. <br />
how much i wish the world was different<br />
I hear your pains and sorrows and want to be distant<br />
but close. I want to draw ever closer to your heart. 

I'm sorry you have to go through the pain of loving someone who doesn't love you back in the same way

I'm fine. I'm ok. <br />
i'm fine, i'm ok<br />
I'm sorry i'm ok<br />


did- @#$%^!@


FUCK THIS

SMASH THE ROOM< GLASS SHATTERING

WHERE IS THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!

...

The truth is.... 

I miss you. and i heard your love is fading away

Oh My God, I love you. 

But Your heart is fading away. 

If only God hadn't said no.
